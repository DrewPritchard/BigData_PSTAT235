# Keeping Track of Things
# Feb 14, 2019

## 1. Make sure we're all connected via github; ensure everyone can load in the data


## 2. Make a plan of attack 
    a. Question:
        1. Can we predict interest in rentals? 
            1.i Which model is better -- multinomial regression or random forest?
            1.ii Which predictors are most important?
        2. <Others>
        
    b. Who is doing what?
        Xining -- working on code for regression and model testing/training
        Jonas -- the features column (amenities)
        Drew -- spatial aspects
        Georgia -- text analysis for description
        
    c. Ground-rules/structure for working together
        i. Meeting times (regular time to meet?) and expectations
        ii. Working with Github -- things to do/do not
    
    d. Date/plan
        Next meeting is after section on Tuesday, Feb 19th
        To do -- Georgia needs to review the methods in R for random forests
        
## 3. Document problems and solutions here:
    a. Error when running the toy example code
        Solution -- Xining will probably run the model on local computer to generate results. We should all verify that we can also run the model on our own laptops.
